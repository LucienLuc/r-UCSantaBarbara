"Revised Library Floor Tier List";-from my last https//wwwredditcom/r/ucsantabarbara/comments/a3tm2v/library_floor_tier_list/  **f tier** floor 3  does this floor even exist go to ucen study rooms  **d tier** floor 1  loud as shit people walking through left and right and talking loudly this is pretty much the equivalent of studying in a hotel lobby your only hope here is to be a degenerate and take a computer station and put your laptop there to study because you get those sweet office chairs unless you cant go up stairs and elevators scare you go to another floor  **c tier** floor 4 pretty much the benchmark from which every other floor is measured the unit floor if you will everything is either better or worse than this floor and theres really not much to say about this one always crowded decently loud lots of people and friends studying together but also has the sick side room outside the elevator which outlets and tables men and womens bathroom this floor is a jack of all trades but master of none some people like to go to it time and time again for a certain familiar comfort others like myself have moved on from freshman year and only use it now if someone asks  **c+ tier** floor 5  heavily moved down from my previous ranking yes the tables are good and yes the outlets are nice but frankly a quiet floor and an open table are never really going to work out long term for you beyond this its only marginally better than floor 4 on its sleeper value if everyone knew about it itd be c-  **b tier** floors 6 and 7 floor 8 but worse **a tier** floor 8  this is going to be the number one floor for most people lets be real if you want to focus work and be productive in the library its this floor you want now i know every excuse in the book  the floor is *too* quiet  its *sooo* far up it takes forever to go down to get something from the arbor  you cant study with friends  yeah tough luck little shit floor 8 is rough its far away its an island in which youre confined to a small box but guess what in this floor you are the most productive in this floor you are the least tempted you are sensory deprived only your work in front of you every excuse against it vague attempts at procastination and you not wanting to actually just get shit done i am not going to mark down floor 8 because of your personal issues with being productive and studying if you want to get as get shit done and feel productive go here if you dont want to thats fine dont go here but dont complain that this floor isnt the best because you cant talk to your friends and go to the arbor on a whim its like a body builder coming up with the perfect workout routine to get you shredded in 3 months and you saying thats too hard just come here and work or dont and dont your call  **s tier** floor 2  floor 2  no thats not a joke  in my previous list i had this ranked as the second bottom tier and now its s tier its the chad floor  but why i always go here and every table is full and its loud and blah blah blah  yeah i didnt say it was the best floor for you i said it was the chad floor if you have friends and you have commitment you can snag a study room here nearly 24/7 oh you want them now during dead week shouldve been there 2 weeks ago trying to book one sucks to suck if you have a study room this floor is pretty much the best thing ever a small isolated room with a large table outlets everywhere its a 2 minute walk to the arbor and back its perfect for inbetween classes or just to hang out with people if you dont really want to study and its also perfect for those late night adderall binged study sessions  close your eyes ill walk you through the life of a floor 2er you just get out of ochem your friends are complaining about how hard the final is going to be and how theres no way that they can study for everything theyre all talking about studying together that cute girl you like comes up to you and says hey xxx were all going to my place to study do you want to come  you look at her and you say oh i have class in 2 hours i was going to go to my study room  dead silence everyone stops talking and looks at you you can see a twinkle of desire in the eyes of your crush she stammers  oh- you have a study room so i guess youre not going to come haha that sucks i have class sorta soon too and-  you cut her off you already know shes begging the question  yeah you wanna come with me you look up to your friends theyre all silent staring they want in will you give it to them you feel generous you guys wanna come too we could order some pizza itll be lit  instantly they look at you with gratitude and appreciation you can see one of your friends shed a tear together you all walk your bikes and skateboards to the library and you go up theres a few people in the room you have reserved laptops set up and notebooks open all deeply in the middle of something  your crush says oh looks like there are people here i guess we dont have to-  you cut her off by walking into the room you stare at the people with curtness and confidence you say uh hey i have this room reserved embarrassment and blushes from everyone in the room they pack up their stuff quietly and skimper out your friends come in awing the room some of them have never been in one before  is that a white board oh dude i shouldve brought a marker   how long do you have it reserved  ooh someone go steal one of the comfortable chairs  you take your place at the head of the table your crush sits by your side you see non-studyroomers walking outside looking in the room yeah they jelly you look at your crush and say im going to go to the arbor you want anything she quietly asks for a yerb you walk out knowing half the pleasure of the room is not being in it all  yeah thats floor 2 for you you missed out this quarter and probably this year but dont worry you always have a chance after summer );-None

How would a guy shoot his shot in this situation?";-i just wanna start by saying that i realize the right play is probably just to acknowledge that while yes she is a physically gorgeous  human being ultimately i dont really know anything about her besides that and the fact she is just a girl trying to live her life as such i should probably just leave her alone (im sure she is inundated with unwanted male attention)  &amp#x200b  but if i were to want to open the door to get to know her what would be some good ways to make an attempt in a way to avoid awkwardness on either side and avoid coming off as creepy at any point  &amp#x200b  the rundown  so this girl works at one of my favorite iv establishments while i only really go there because i genuinely enjoy their product (just trying to keep it vague here)  whenever i do see her there its like wild gorgeous girl has appearedwhich is nice im sure that at best she just recognizes me as a regular(ish) customer probably doesnt know my name and if she has any impression of my character its probably that im shy which im not really but in the handful of interactions ive had with her i probably have come off as shy looking back at it some hard facts there is in my opinion a huge disparity in our level of attractiveness im sure there are girl just as attractive as her out there but youd be hard pressed to find someone more attractive while in comparison to her id be primordial slime now dont get me wrong i dont go around feeling sorry for myself for not being (again in my opinion) attractive and i do have plenty of dating experience some with girls id even consider to be very cute (but no one quite as physically attractive as this girl) my feeling about it is that im definitely the type of guy you date more for their personality than their looks (and obviously not every girl is gonna like my personality)  so what im trying to say here is that shes hot and im not and while it isnt the end of the world i aint gonna sugar coat it for myself this is an obstacle  also i was swiping through tinder and her profile came up her bio wasnt particularly informative but of course i was gonna swipe right i considered super liking her for a moment but then i realized shes gonna see that and when she (inevitably) swipes left it might be awkward when i show up where she works after that and i still want to be able to go there so i didnt super like and swiped right this is probably already obvious but i dont feel its a good idea to approach her too directly at work (if even at all) &amp#x200b  after that i was just stuck with the thought is there any way literally any way that i could approach this girl and get to know her better without coming off as creepy just having it be awkward or even potentially getting laughed off even if it ended up with us becoming friends id be happy with that i understand people just like what they like its not (or at least usually not) personal and im probably just not that for her or her type i just dont want to use some false pretext and not be honest or up front from the beginning &amp#x200b  please keep it positive constructive criticism is good but if you dont have anything nice to say just dont say it at all thanks;-None

"UCSB or UCI for undergrad physics";-i just finished my second year as a physics major at a uc and i’ve been accepted to uc irvine and uc santa barbara for physics as a third year transfer i’m having a tough choice between the two universities and tldr i just feel that academically ucsb would be the better choice but i would enjoy being at uci more i want to go to grad school when i finish my bachelors at one of these two schools so i know that research opportunity is a big factor when i comes to being a strong applicant currently i have 0 research experience (yeah i’m behind) but academically i’ve been at the top of my classes (have good relationships with all my physics professors so far  i would say and have asked for letters of rec) and have a 38 gpa so i would say if i add in some research experience within these two upcoming years i would have really good chances of getting into a top school  i’m not sure which specific area of physics yet but i’m hoping i would be certain on one soon  so i know that ucsb is known to have one of the best physics programs (#2 public university in ca right behind ucb) so ucsb is pretty respected among the “physics world” i know that uci has a great physics program as well but when it comes down to it does the undergrad university matter do grad schools take it as a huge factor when considering an applicant i heard that students in the college of creative studies have high chances of getting into a good grad school because they are well prepped so i was looking forward to the program however i also heard that they don’t care much for transfer students and it’s hard for transfer students to be admitted into ccs does anybody have more info on this  i visited both ucsb and uci this week and here’s what i thought of it (please don’t think i’m disrespecting either campus because both are really good campuses and this is just my personal take on it)  when i first got to ucsb i saw a lot of people walking around and immediately saw the chill vibe of the area but i don’t like the surrounding college town isla vista i’ve heard about how the landlords are super bad and the housing is overpriced for the small space you get don’t get me wrong i’m into the party scene but it’s just not a big factor i feel like i need i’m more into partying with friends rather than huge blowouts with strangers the reason i don’t like it is because it’s pretty messy and dirty i like working from home and a clean working space is a high priority to me i envy the students here who are able to balance everything but i feel that if i try hard enough i can get it done as well i also feel like the buildings are a bit old but the campus overall is alright however the building for the college of creative studies is a run down yellow box and the the building that says physics on it (i think it’s offices and labs for grad students) looks like a jail inside but other than that the modern side of the library the physical science building and the engineering buildings are beautiful i also know that ucsb has the kavli institute of theoretical physics but as an undergrad does that matter much(aside from sitting in on seminars from physicists that are here for that resource of course) the side by the lagoon is also beautiful and i really liked it another thing i liked was that the beach is next to the school so i can see why a lot of people says ucsb is gorgeous i’m not a big fan of downtown as well it’s an okay city with some alright food places but i personally love asian cuisine and i didn’t find any great boba or pho/noodle spots (i’m sure there are some outside of goleta)  when i first got to uci i was amazed at how different it is compared to ucsb it’s almost a complete flip the nature and beach was swapped for an extremely clean city with not much of a sense of close community like isla vista i thought the campus itself was also okay but what stood out to me was how close everything is there’s a little plaza with target trader joe’s chick fil a etc literally next to campus also the park in the middle of campus seems like a peaceful area (i didn’t like how hilly the inner campus is though) the best thing about going to uci is that one of my close friends who goes there right now is looking for a housemate for a house 10 min walking distance from campus (so i don’t have to worry about housing) i also know a lot of people who go there but i don’t think this is a big deal because college is about making new friends and forming new connections but i feel that it should be said because that’s why i’m more certain i will have a better time at uci another big thing is that la and sd is 1-2hrs away + more food areas the down sides are that the party life nightlife and the physics isn’t as strong as compared to ucsb however my intuition led me to think this uci is still a research university with a lot of resources related to physics wouldn’t it be easier to gain research experience here compared to ucsb since not many come to uci for the physics major idk just a thought might be wrong i think the biggest factors influencing my decision are how well i think i will do in academics how much research i can get done and how much i will enjoy the overall experience please comment and share any insight you have in what i should take account of or any advice in general;-None

"Upperclassman apartment questions";-hi i just decided to submit my intent to register today ive been looking through upperclassmen apartments and comparing them to private apartments and ive got a couple questions &amp#x200b  one of the biggest concerns is that many privately owned rental properties do not have gyms and laundry areas is that really a big deal ive heard mixed reviews of the ucsb gym and im not too keen on going to laundromats however the potential savings of having included off-street parking from many private rentals is appealing &amp#x200b  additionally is it worthwhile to live a bit closer to campus the upperclassmen apartments are almost all farther from the campus than private rentals school housing                        private housing  &amp#x200b  |\~720-750/month|\~700-850/month (havent been able to look at the official ucsb rental services to get a good idea of prices as i cant make an account yet)| |-|-| |\+9 month terms - 6500-6750|\-typically 12 month terms - 8400 - 10200 (but i get to stay through summer)| |\-no parking - 500-750 a year for pass (again not sure how it works)|\+usually included parking| |\+included utilities|\-have to pay for electricity + gas -- shouldnt exceed 25 a month for 300 throughout the entire year| |\+included gym &amp laundry room|\-no gym &amp laundry would have to go to campus or nearby| |\+easy payments through ucsb|\-chance of being hassled by roommates and getting locked in a lease with troglodytes | |\+shorter walk to beach and campus|\-longer walk everywhere| |\+furnished|\-usually not furnished but roommates can help contribute furniture|  &amp#x200b  so theyre roughly the same price monthly only its tougher to find private housing with shorter terms so id likely end up paying for summers im not sure if subletting will be easy considering at that price range im going to be splitting a room plus the demand for summer housing seems negligible compared to the relative supply &amp#x200b  i guess id just appreciate some insight from current ucsb students im probably wrong about some if not all of the generalizations ive made ive got \~2 weeks to make a decision as id rather not pay a 350 dollar penalty to cancel a contract  &amp#x200b  for those who couldnt be bothered to read the overarching question is whether its more worthwhile to seek private housing or upperclassman housing thank you;-None

"Math Department becomes a huge problem!";-i am now a math-major undergraduate student i want to take phd program and pursue an academic career recently tens of math or math-science major seniors cant get in their courses like math104a math111a or math 118a the department finally realized that they need to solve some problems however the problems of math department is far more than that  &amp#x200b  there are lots of excellent professors in the math department most of them are very kind and helpful and also talented i respect every single one of them i personally want to take mathematics as a career so i know how hard it is to get a tenure however the math department does show its real strength to people if you visit the official ucsb math department website and click the events you will see the first event in the event archive is still the event of 2016 also if want to know some information about the seminars for example now the top seminar is algebraic geometry seminar if you click that link you will find that the information is still for fall 2017 &amp#x200b  now i will state my personal experience i self-studied a lot of content so basically i dont go to lectures i never lost an a for the math-major required courses &amp#x200b  it is pretty weird for me i need to pay my expansive tuition but all i did is to self-study i tried to go to lectures and find something i can learn from however in most cases i cant find any they are excellent professors for sure and there are a lot of beautiful math that i can learn from them but what they teach in the lower division or math108ab117 are too easy for me  &amp#x200b  so years ago i asked the department if i can take exams and credits it is a school policy i saw on the website see here [https//mysaucsbedu/catalog/current/academicpoliciesprocedures/creditbyexaminationaspx](https//mysaucsbedu/catalog/current/academicpoliciesprocedures/creditbyexaminationaspx)  &amp#x200b  i said that i want to take exams to passmath117math108ab i said that you can test me in any form and i will prove my ability in this way i can take more advanced courses which are fit me more and i can give spaces to people who need those courses (after all i did not go to lectures)  &amp#x200b  but they denied me they said the math department has the right to decide if the school policy works here i thought that  it was fine after all learning knowledge is mostly my personal work it is not that important to take lectures  &amp#x200b  however i really want to my undergraduate academic record can reflect my real ability i am not a genius i can not solve some big math problems in my undergraduate years but i want to do math research and i have certain ability my gpa is about 4 but i dont think it can reflect my ability those courses are too easy for me so i want to have some records for example graduate courses are pretty good i have confidence to take graduate courses and get as so i ask that the math department if i can take graduate courses the department told me you have to complete math108ab math122ab math111abc math118abc  &amp#x200b  i will explain how ridiculous it is after i entered ucsb i took every single math course i can take (basically two years i took math4ab 6ab 8 108ab 113 117 119 122ab 124 145 147) now in the gold fall registration i am a senior but now even on the waitlist of 118a i am at 44th place &amp#x200b  even seniors are so hard to add math118 or math111 let alone juniors so what does it mean when the department is saying you have to take math111abc math118abc to petition a graduate course it means that it is impossible  it is pretty good if you can add math118abc as a senior if you want to take graduate courses in the senior year you have to complete 111 and 118 in the junior year right how can it be possible note that the gold says i am a senior now and i am 44th on the waitlist (the lecture has 45 people in total but the waitlist is longer than that and in which most of them are seniors) also the math118 series use the textbook baby rudin i started to read it and did exercises carefully when i was in high school the math111 is about algebra this is what i want to do in the future i cant have problem in those undergraduate math courses  i self-studied those material a long time ago i accept any form of exam to test my ability and i strongly want to prove it unfortunately the department does care about it  &amp#x200b  there are a lot of other unpleasant experience but i dont want to write more as an international student i came here for those excellent professors and the academic freedom but now even graduation becomes a problem &amp#x200b  last year i as one of three ucsb team members took the putnam math competition i ranked the 1st in the ucsb and my ucsb team got its best rank (29th) ever i fought for ucsb but what did it do to me as the best or at least one of the best undergraduate student in the ucsb math-major i tried to transfer to ccs so i can have an earlier passtime or to take more courses but they denied me even before i submit my recommendation letters i tried to take exams for credits which is good for me and for other students they denied me i tried to take graduate courses they told me that ridiculous policy i paid my tuition and took competiton as ucsb team member they did give me what i should get until now only one excellent phd candidate here really gave me some help for my study except that i didnt get any help from the whole math department  &amp#x200b  next year or next next year (if i have to take another year thanks to the math department) i will definitely not take part in the putnam competition as a team member as an undergraduate i dont have enough knowledge and i know that i need to improve myself constantly to build my own value now it is probably the only way that i can fight against them though they will probably care  &amp#x200b  now math104a math111a math118a are all becomes huge problems for seniors a year ago i wrote letters to them about my concern of the spaces of those courses they replied me saying that it is not a problem for sure now the math department is now working this issue out they have not give any solution yet i dont know what the solution will be but there is a really funny story after the department sends the email saying  &amp#x200b  i know that many of you are not able to get into math 118a right now we have enabled the waitlist now and you should be able to add to it if you need math 118a for fall please add to the waitlist now and we will do our best to get students into the course   we will be prioritizing graduating senior students who are math bs and math science majors   &amp#x200b  then they send a email about the graduate courses  we have received many inquires about taking graduate level math courses as undergraduate students last year the undergraduate committee created a policy that students are **required** to take math 108ab 111abc 118abc and 122ab before registering for graduate level courses there will be no exception to this policy please note that even if you have completed these courses the instructor can still deny the petition   &amp#x200b  i dont know what to say the department knows even seniors cant get in math118 so aha i understand if i want to take graduate courses as an undergraduate i probably need to spend another year (or another two years) after the senior year &amp#x200b  now i dont want to do anything about those department policies it is a joke and i wont try i wrote this just because for some students who are considering take ucsb math major especially for those students with certain talent and want to do math research in the future i have many friends who were previously in math major but they cant get spaces for their courses then they change a major or change math to math-science i went to the gold and see what the pstat courses look like it is amazing they have so many spaces for each courses people dont need to worry about it but i love math so much and i want to take phd program and do research i cant change a major it is my mistake that i didnt transfer to another institution  no matter how hard you worked and how i fought for the ucsb in the competition the department wont give you any opportunity want to take graduate courses fine just spend another year here;-None

"UCSB is turning liberal ideals into liberal propaganda.";-hello your favorite (least favorite) shit talker again coming at you in response to a post on facebook speaking out against conservative speakers coming on campus specifically ben shapiro  first off the post said shapiro was a member of the alt-right (which cannot be further from the truth shapiro is number one on the alt-right’s shit list) and that he and other conservative speakers should be barred from speaking on campus to be abundantly clear i do not in no way shape or form advocate or support the inclusion of alt-right speakers coming to our campus any speech that encourages or enacts violence from nazi groups or white supremacists should not be tolerated however conservative speakers have a presence in our government why should our campus be any different the post also suggested that shapiro and other conservative speakers insight violence but ironically enough that violence is typically insighted from the far left in opposition to their right wing conservatism no neo-nazi or white supremacist can honestly cite ben shapiro as the cause of their violence conservative isn’t a “dirty word” it’s real ideology that should have a place in academic discourse i do not and i make this again abundantly clear identify nor support the republican party i politically identify as a moderate however those on our campus who do should be able to explore their republican affiliations in an academic setting without persecution pushing and allowing a stage for only liberal ideals and liberal personalities only hinders our ability to be politically involved individuals in our modern society exposing myself to right wing ideology and media has actually made me stronger in my left wing affiliations by barring non violent right wing speakers the university is doing ourselves a disservice focusing on purely one side of the political spectrum without allowing any contrary ideals to have a stage they are pushing liberal propaganda it baffles me how education individuals allow themselves to be so easily manipulated;-None

"California Tacos &amp; Taproom - Review";-so i tried this place i give it a c+ ie not good enough to make it in iv  the food is pretty good but it is way overpriced and the portions are small think $11 for a burrito that is 1/2 to 2/3 the size of a cucas or freebirds burrito and then a soft drink is $3 so your looking at $15 for lunch and not really being satisfied and they cut the burritos in half who does that and why  the calinachos (cucas fries and meat) which is $10 is a good deal however plenty of food maybe even too much and the fries they use are seasoned like curly fries it was however light on the meat  the tacos (didnt try these) are $3 a piece and they look like street tacos so we are talking about meat onions cilantro you can get a plate of 5 of them for ~14 so they give you about a buck off for ordering in bulk  the salsas were pretty good but not spectacular  if this place makes it it will be purely based on the chill vibe of the patio seating and the beer on tap the people working there (as of my visit) were pretty cool too this place cant compete on its food alone in regards to the other mexican food competition in iv (rosarito cucas kinda freebirds)  a former tenant of this location (santa ynez burritos) flamed out quickly with a very similar menu pricing and environment and the other 2 mexican places in iv that recently failed (the cantina and el sitio) proved that the mexican food market is limited to a couple places and then they are competing against all the other food in iv too  my overall take on this is that they need to spec out the competition and then offer one of two things something cheaper or something better i dont think they succeeded on either point  some might argue that the taproom portion of the restaurant is unique to iv but right now i think that woodstocks and pizza my heart are filling that role  i give them 2 years tops  side note how the hell is aladdins cafe still open  tldr  pros chill vibe plenty of patio seating beer on tap  cons over priced small portions cursed location;-None

"Psych &amp; Brain Sciences Transfer Experience";-i applied as a psych major to all the ucs and ultimately chose to come to ucsb because i thought pbs was a unique major compared to other schools none of the other ucs requires us to complete 1 full year of general chemistry for psych so naturally i only took 1 semester of chem at cc now that im here i have to do chem 1b and chem 1c this school year + mcdb 1a/eemb2 in the summer in order to \~maybe\~ graduate on time chem 1c isnt absolutely required for our major but transfers need to take it in order to enroll in the summer bio courses as a transfer i have no choice but to take chem 1c if i want to be admitted into my major by 4th year then when im finally full major status ill only have 3 quarters to complete all of my ud requirements for psych &amp#x200b  please tell me im not the only one who feels like i got tricked into coming to this school &amp#x200b  i just feel like im doing so much unnecessary work just to get the same degree i wouldve gotten if i had gone to any other uc the worst part is advisors didnt tell transfers that we were 2 years behind if we didnt complete 1 year of chem until orientation if i had known i needed to complete chem before coming here i wouldve finished it last summer &amp#x200b  \*\*side note what does chem have to do with psych lol why do i have to complete a full year of general chemistry just to be admitted into my major then ill be taking classes that ultimately have nothing to do with bio and chem at all ucsd only requires 1 quarter of chem to get a bs in psychology which makes farrrr more sense to me than 1 full year of chem for transfers studying psychology \*\* btw im not complaining because i cant keep up with the curriculumim actually doing really well right now (gpa-wise) im just getting frustrated by the lack of support for transfers at ucsb especially transfers in the pbs major our advisors practically laugh in our faces when we tell them were struggling to plan our schedule;-None

"Am I the only one?";-sorry for the ambiguous title but i have been needing to get something off my chest i am really questioning if my time at ucsb was worth it  i transferred in fall 2017 i was choosing between uci and ucsb but decided on sb first because of the major then study abroad opportunities and then location my ma sometimes would drive to sb for work and always told me how lovely it was i was happy at my cc and had a good amount of friends and i thought uni would be the same if not better but now nearly 2 years into transferring i feel like my experiences here were nothing like i imagined besides the horrible weather and ugly beaches i have had nothing but nightmare roommates and to this day have not made a single friend i would not describe myself as either introvert or extrovert i am not scared of talking to new people but at every club i tried to join i have never clicked with anyone  i also wasn’t well aware of how hard it was to graduate on time as a transfer so i ended up giving up studying abroad to finish on time and also for money’s sake the most challenging part has been the return of my ocd symptoms due to a very traumatic experience with a specific roommate i was diagnosed with ocd at 13 and have been in and out of therapy but this recent relapse was the toughest i have ever had to deal with my saving grace is that sb has an ocd center close to where i live overall i feel disappointed depressed and alone after class i just study by myself i don’t go out with anyone i really don’t know what i could’ve done differently and it has been a huge blow to my self-confidence at this point i feel like i’m leaving the university worse off mentally/emotionally that i started with and i’m questioning if a ba was worth it i have only 5 weeks left until graduation but i find it harder and harder to maintain focus and motivation  well thanks for letting me vent a bit i was wondering if anyone can sympathize with my ucsb experience;-None

"Hey guys, UCSB admit here looking see whether going to UCSB a better choice than University of Washington!";- i’ve been fortunate enough to get into both of these schools but am still racking my head into whether uw or ucsb should be the school i go to this fall i recently went to both campuses last week and ended up loving both of them for different reasons ucsb has really fantastic weather and it’s right next to the beach making it one of the most beautiful campuses i’ve been to so far not to mention the multitude of bike paths it has wrapping in and out of campus uw on the other hand is amazing due to how it’s a 10 minute drive from seattle making it much better for networking and professional opportunities than ucsb its transportation system with the free shuttles and light rail for students is something that’s a huge plus as well  however after searching around for other posts on what people thought of other schools some cons for both schools have popped up some of these questions are related to uw so if you have any insight answer away  1 do the capacity-constrained majors for uw (i’m going for econ specifically \*48% admit rate with 35 avg gpa) affect how students interact with each other drastically i’ve heard some posts talking about how some uw students are very withdrawn and highly competitive due to the limited amounts of space in each major 2 how bad is the “party school” reputation of ucsb i’m not a party-goer myself but i’m afraid that i might miss out or struggle on meeting new people without going to parties 3 how are professional opportunities at ucsb i’ve also heard many stories about how ucsb students can’t afford to live in santa barbara after graduating from ucsb and having to move elsewhere additionally from my initial visit it feels as if ucsb doesn’t have as many large companies in the vicinity as uw which might make it harder to score interviews and internships there 4 am i missing out on experiencing new things and staying in a “bubble” if i head to ucsb i know its professors are world-class but would i be progressing more as a person if i head off to uw (i know it’s up to me to meet new people and seek out new things but would it be any different/better at another state)  5 i’ve been trying to look into what makes each respective econ program from both schools so good but i can’t seem to find anything browsing through their econ department websites is there some hidden source i’m not looking at for this info  thanks for taking the time to read this and answering some (or all) of the questions i’ve asked;-None

"I want to transfer, but I'm scared that UCSB won't be where I belong";-let me start off by saying i grew up in what i and many people considered to be small town it was very safe had about 100k people not a lot to do but go to the movies or mulligans and everytime i went to the mall or walmart i would always run into former classmates who i ignored to avoid having to exchange the awkward hellos  i was burnt out from hs and needed a change because even though i lived there since i was 5 i never really felt like i fit in even though i met some nice people and made some good friends  my college goals were to get a degree from a school with nice academics and finally have a nice school experience high school was pretty bittersweet and even though ive never been that popular i was hoping to meet a nice group of friends consisting of 3-5 people who treated and care for me like family and maybe if i was lucky enough  maybe finally get into more of serious relationship with a special someone i just wanted to have a fun and fulfilling college experience because i was a really homebody in hs mainly because i had no car and license and plus my parents are viet and hella strict so going out was never option for me  originally my plan was to go study international relations at san francisco state because it had the major i needed because i wanted to go to  into foreign policy and what city could be more fun than san francisco  everything seemed to fit into place until my parents crushed my dreams my parents show me more love than most asian parents do for their children but their love can be really clingy and toxic  plus theyre conservative so they didnt want me to go sf because they were worried being around  so many gay people  would make me guy which is stupid because i grew up in socal plus they had a problem with it being so far  so i was forced to attend ucr because there was no way in hell my parents were going to put me on a plane to sf plus it was 35 minutes away from my hometown tooi know that im an adult and should be able to make my own decisions but its hard when youre financially dependent on them i  tried to be positive because i was going to a uc and honestly i thought i might like it better because ucr was 30 percent asian and had way more vietnamese people compared to my hometown which was conservative and majority white but my attempts to make close friends became futile each time i tried joining clubs like vsa(vietnamese student association) and even got  a big family and everything but my big wasnt the best person for me and vsa felt too cliquey and i felt so isolated from everyone i rushed for ifc frats and asian frats  but i couldnt go through the hazing process for asian and got rejected easily from ifc which was no brainer because a lot of the guys are attractive in the ifc and im so ugly  now going into my 2nd year i got put into a student apartment with randoms who are alright personality wise but they are so fucking messy like left a cup in the sink and it started molding messy i have no close friends that hit me up and im too shy to hit anyone up because last year i kept trying to make plans with groups of people but they never had time and i gave up out of embarrassment all the people who i tried getting close to last year just used me by taking advantage of kindness to buy them food and birthday gifts the only time i get any social interaction is when people asking me for notes and help for assignments i feel like such a freak because i just want to come off as a chill and fun guy but no gets my sarcasm or dry humor and just assume im being serious and rude everyone seems to joke around with each other but attack me for it when i try  i tried joining other cultural organizations like csa or a pre law fraternity but i dont feel like i fit in either club ive never been so depressed in my life until i came to ucr like i went from being excited my 1st year in the fall to crying late at night in dorm hallway because i couldnt believe my life has gotten so terrible in the spring  my depression has cleared up mostly going into current spring quarter because i got my acceptance to ucsb but im worried ill be like ucr i have no problem with leaving ucr because i im already done with it honestly i see no hope in trying to make close friends as pretty much everyone else especially  those in my year have already established their own friend groups and wouldnt want a loser like me anyway i partied and yack too much my 1st year so everyone that knows me has pretty much already gotten a negative vibe and impression from me plus im tired of wishing that ill get better when i know at this point that as long as i stay at ucr it wont  im sorry that it was long and for those of you who read it until the end thank you because i really do appreciate it im not trying to kill anyones mood with my depressing post but i thought it was important that i give you guys some background information on my mindset i just really want a fresh start at ucsb im not sure where ill live but im leaning toward the santa ynez apartments i just want these last two years to go well for once because im worried that my worst fear will come true  which is that ill finish college with no real experience and no real close friends made and that concerns me because if i cant make it work in college socially then how will i be able to handle life after college;-None

"I'm a first-year having trouble making solid friendships. Do any of you have any advice?";-hello fello gauchos  so im a first-year living in manzanita ive always had a pretty close group of friends growing up however while ive been here i feel like ive made a lot of acquaintances but very few close friendships (if any at all) for example i eat with some people from my classes every so often and i work on homework/study with them pretty often in any of these cases i feel like i enjoy their company but i dont just hang out with them regularly like they do with each other for context i also have a girlfriend who ive been with for a while here and shes awesome ive always had the privilege of having a close circle of friends in high school and in other activities ive done but here for the first time i feel very alone and friendless i have been dealing with pretty bad (clinical)depression since my last year of high school and my hypothesis now is that ive become somewhat of a fragment of a person thats just too boring to connect with others i try to be considerate and to remember things about people and to ask about them but it always seems like they would rather be with their real friends than me im pretty sick of it to be honest going through every day is agonizing and i think having friends like i did would make it better ive noticed that i feel better about myself and everything else when i have a social interaction that i judge to be positive for both the person/people im talking to and i i want to change and i want to be better but i feel broken id imagine that my experience is quite common for freshmen so in r/learnmaths fashion i will explain what ive done and ask for advice from those who are more knowledgeable on the kind of things that might be to come ive sought out medical treatment(medication therapy) for my condition and ive tried to just be myself around people more ive also started exercising every day i plan on joining some relevant clubs(possibly an org like ato) to me next quarter so i can put myself out there more and also so i can do more things(generally i dont do a lot right now my day is mostly spend on youtube and studying)  a large piece of advice i see on making close friends is that i should organize my own hang outs and invite people even if i dont feel that close to them however ive always struggled with that and especially now i would have a really hard time doing that however if it really seems like thats the one thing i need to do to improve everything then i absolutely will do it for those of you whove gone through something even remotely similar did it help is it worth the effort i get scared that i already have what i want and i just dont realize it but i feel like somethings different but i suppose that might just be how college is for all of you that respond in any way thank you so much i really really appreciate it ;-None

"Professors who seemed to want to be a resource for me are completely ignoring me and I don't know how to be more proactive without being impolite";-i have made a few strong connections with professors of mine (both as a student and as an assistant in their lab) just this last fall quarter i worked in a lab with a professor who would verbally discuss with me how much theyve appreciated me and my work in their lab by around week 7 of the quarter we talked on numerous occasions about writing me a letter of recommendation to which she said she would be more than happy  additionally i had become pretty close with a current class professor she expressed that she loved having me in class and complimented my academic spirit frequently i went to her office hours every week and this professor became somewhat of a career mentor for me she would tell me about opportunities going so far as to saying that she could get me into career positions that i was interested in she would often say that i can always contact her about anything even after the quarter is over but these conversations only started coming up really by around week 8 or so i decided that my main priority would be focusing on killing finals and then follow up with these connections  i have reached out to both of these professors via email almost *5 times each* (a few times weeks 8-10 once during winter break once during week 1 of winter) asking my lab professor for a letter of rec and my mentor professor to meet up with me at her office and talk more about the career ideas and opportunities that i am dying to get involved with **both of them have completely ignored every single email i have sent them** they never ignored a single email of mine while i was enrolled with them during fall quarter i understand that their busy people with new students and new schedules but why offer themselves as a resource to me beyond the quarter and then never follow through  its becoming really disheartening because it makes me question whether or not any of it was ever honest at all i know that as an undergrad youre supposed to be extremely proactive about this stuff but now that i am not enrolled in their classes/labs this quarter i dont know how/when to drop by their office in person and confront them about it  i guess the main reason i am writing this is because i am frustrated as hell that i could potentially miss out on life-changing opportunities in a situation that doesnt even feel like i am responsible for missing out on i feel like i am putting a lot of effort into making it extremely clear to them that i am a really eager and determined student yet their lack of any effort to respond feels like a little bit of a betrayal to me does anyone have similar experiences with professors and mentors on campus **what am i doing wrong** am i just supposed to stalk outside their office doors unwarranted in between classes until i see them and ask them if theyve seen my 5+ emails i sent them  any advice is welcome theres still a lot about the uc world that i dont understand and i havent made enough connections like this to know if this is normal i just really dont want to screw this whole thing up for no reason at all;-None

"[3rd Year Transfer/Biopsych] Terrible First Quarter at UCSB. Might need to switch majors?";-been dreading making this post but i wanted some insight from you guys **year** 3rd year (transfer student 1st quarter at ucsb)  **major** pre-biopsychology  took 16 units this quarter that wasnt advised by my friends or counselors thinking itd be like community college where it was semester system and id have enough time to study for each of my classes if i just put in the time &amp i was so wrong  ---------------------------- schedule ----- * **chem 109a** organic chemistry (w/bruice - no curve) 4 units  * **mcdb 1a+l** intro bio + lab (i have credit for eemb 3 + l) 5 units  * **psy 102** social psychology  4 units  * **psy 7** experimental psychology (last quarter it is being taught) 3 units  total 16 units ----------------------- ------------------  i ended up feeling like i didnt have adequate time to thoroughly study for every individual class when midterm season started - i had midterms from week 3 all the way till the week after thanksgiving break which was like week 7/8 it was ridiculous and i was cramming to study for the final right ahead of me instead of studying collectively for all my classes and getting ahead  the class that took the most time out of my days was organic chemistry - i took clas for that class and spent the majority of my time doing book problems out of bruices textbook and reviewing prior terms exams but i could never finish every problem before a midterm/final because of time-restraints due to exams/projects from other classes  organic chemistry is the class i struggled the most in so i naturally spent a lot of my time studying for it but took away a lot of time from my other classes that i felt i couldve done very well had i taken my other classes with ochem or vice versa - done well in ochem &amp everything else overall had i just stuck closer to the recommended 12 units for my first term  the issue now is that i needed a b- or a 27 gpa in solely psy 7 to be granted into the biopsychology major and i dont even think i managed to pull that off because i wasnt able to split up my time studying efficiently for all my classes (i think i got an a on the final or close but i got 60% on the first two midterms)  so now im left with probably a terrible gpa and im locked out of the biopsychology major because i didnt meet the gpa prerequisite (because i chose to take the old biopsych psy 3/psy 7 route instead of new biopsych psych 10a &amp 10b route) - i cannot retake psy 7 because its not taught again and i am not allowed to take 10a &amp 10b  i emailed my pbs advisors just now to figure out what to do i just feel so defeated  i may or may not be eligible to try and go for pre-biology/biology ive finished chem physics calc and just need mcdb 1b &amp eemb 2 + lab ive never studied so much to do mediocre/barely pass (if even that)  this quarter has been so overwhelming and kicked my ass so hard &amp i honestly tried to do everything i could that i did at community college that got me as &amp bs in my courses - but that didnt cut it  i got a c- in psy 102 hoping for a c in ochem 109a (but i dont mind retaking it i know id do well the second time around with a less packed school schedule) at least a c in psy 7 (a b- if im extremely lucky) and hopefully at least a c (could be higher after the curve) in mcdb 1a and a a/b in mcdb 1al  any advice in doing better i have goals of pursuing pre-med track but i feel so embarrassed to even say that with my performance after this quarter  im definitely going to stick to 12 units next quarter;-None

"the negative effects of one-sided (liberal) teaching @UCSB";-this is an essay for one of my classes read it all for an understanding of where im coming from i dont have any political preference but this biased method of teaching needs to be stopped teach both sides  &amp#x200b  i always found it interesting how people connect and act around each other i knew there was a deeper science behind all of it so a sociology class seemed fantastic for the fall quarter at ucsb sociology is defined as the study of the development structure and functioning of human society and also explains how and why people interact with each other as you could imagine there isn’t a simple way to explain every detail of the complex science of sociology to college students to try to help us understand each topic professor gordon posts several articles or book excerpts each week which correspond to each unit’s main point of emphasis however through deeper analysis of some of these sources i found a problem the ways these literary practices are written and presented to the class suggest a left-leaning political motivation which tries to mold the minds of the students to think a certain way the first source is a novel written by mary romero *maid in the usa* which magnifies the issue of racial and gender equality while simultaneously exploring the lives of undocumented mexican women working in the domestic service industry in her time exploring the inner workings of the domestic service industry in this area she mentions that she was a maid at one time and goes on to share her experiences during work she tells her readers that her values and ideals were often met with “resistance and shame” (romero 7) she then expands to her findings on current domestic service workers through interviews she begins by introducing the fact that “the hiring of maids from mexico was so common that locals referred to monday as border patrol’s day off because the agents ignored the women crossing the border” followed by the statement that they deserve “a more humanistic working environment” and higher wages (romero 15) racism and condescending on people because of their race gender or social status is always going to be unacceptable however romero’s diction writing choices and view of how they deserve higher wages is evidently one of an *illegal* immigrant-friendly one which is typically a liberal one in our society today overall *maid in the usa* develops a sensitivity to undocumented workers in the united states in the minds of the students of this class this sensitivity will be rooted in most of their minds when thinking about the current immigration debate in our country and consequently might show in future voting situations  the next source of discussion will be a study done by oxfam entitled “the cost of war afghan experiences of conflict” which aims to inform people of real afghan civilians’ accounts of how the multiple wars in afghanistan have affected them during the war and peace unit professor gordon wasn’t shy to tell the class her opinions of the military and its actions she has said multiple times that the military “causes so much sorrow” around the world due to the killing torture displacement and general carelessness for civilians this article is most likely chosen to support her claims which is introduced with statistics 700 afghans were interviewed and 43% reported having property destroyed 76% were displaced from home 13% were imprisoned and 21%  were tortured (oxfam 4) these are staggering numbers which initially shocked me and made me consider that the us military presence in afghanistan is having an extremely hurtful effect on the people there however after another half an hour of reading there were tables which showed the percent of people displaced tortured injured and imprisoned during each conflict the four conflicts shown are the communist government (1979-1992) the civil war (1992-1996) taliban rule (1996-2001) and the “current conflict” (2001-present) the us military has only been there since 2001 and with this in mind and the statements from professor gordon it is very safe to say that the us has very little to do with the damage done on afghan civilians during the “current conflict” none of the 700 interviewees were imprisoned only 5 were tortured and only 3 were injured (oxfam 37-39) evidently the us military has not been a big factor in the mistreatment of these particular afghan civilians at all much less when compared to other ruthless power during past conflicts there the “evil” ways of the military (as described by professor gordon) are very scarce in this day and age with new rules of engagement and higher war crime sentences there is a high probability that a *small* amount of us soldiers over the course of history have killed and hurt innocents on purpose however the *overwhelming* majority are just men and women taking orders and doing whatever they can to protect their country but still the article represents the point of view that the military shouldn’t be causing any harm to the innocent civilians living in the area this idea of retreating from war in the middle east was seen in president obama’s agenda a liberal and is being taught in this class without informing the students of the potentially devastating results if there were no troops there at all to contain terrorism  literacy practices are abundant in this class as a result of the professor assigning readings usually three or four articles passages or studies that her students must read before the next lecture each week brings a new topic and if it’s a new topic the subject of the readings always correspond the very first reading is *the sociological imagination* written by c wright mills a book that tries to force the reader to consider their lives from an outsider’s perspective and in turn encourages the students to think about where they stand in the world and the current state that the world is in additionally it is stressed that our society’s policies can be changed if everyone is on the same page mentally this piece essentially opens up the students’ minds to make them realize that every personal issue and every world issue can be fixed through resistance even if in extremely small numbers this process is known as the lilliput strategy and is stressed throughout the entire course and proves to be the piece that ties everything together in the course it essentially says that all of these problems problems of today’s democratic party can be changed with resistance  in addition to the readings there are multiple films shown during lectures that reflect this liberal point of view after interviewing my friend nicole a self-proclaimed moderate who got an a in sociology 1 last year it was indisputable that other students were recognizing this bias too when asked about the films she responded with “some of the films were pretty liberal…” one in particular was called *a day’s work a day’s pay* (2001) which interviewed a group of welfare workers in new york city who were protesting to get a higher wage most of whom did not even receive a high school diploma but it took the viewers into the perspective of their personal lives and how they have families to care for like the rest of us the liberal point of view sticks out extremely in this movie because they are constantly fighting for higher wages for people who don’t have a proper education consequently raising taxes for the rest of the population understanding that they have families who wouldn’t feel bad for them however conservatives would argue the point that the decision to start a family at a time when they were unemployed is a dumb mistake this movie along with the readings demonstrate the arbitrary stance of the professor and the school as a whole considering all of these sources the way they are written and order they are presented in add up to suggest a strong left-leaning political motivation by whoever decides the curriculum content each are helpful to both understand the course and what potential message is trying to be sent to the students whose minds are very open to new ideas with *the sociological imagination* followed by the oxfam study and the other articles in the war and peace unit which are against the global war in afghanistan and “militarism” in the us also the film *a day’s work a day’s pay* and *maid in the usa* which might help develop a sensitivity to uneducated and undocumented workers in the united states it is clear that the professor wants students to recognize the liberal side of each story and recognize that they can change any of these issues using my “sociological imagination” regarding this course it is not appropriate for the school to allow this one-sided teaching rather we should be informing students on *both* sides of every issue regardless of the professors’ political views as nicole says “its a liberal university but it should be kept out of the classroom so we can teach both sides” this would allow students to choose whatever side of the political spectrum they believe that they side with in 2018 it seems everyone down to the kids in middle school have a political view and it’s extremely unlikely that these kids or anybody else knows every fact surrounding every matter so who does it come from the answer is parents friends and teachers that only explain their impressions who are often also uninformed this way of teaching is a huge problem these days and should be halted immediately the literary practices within sociology 1 here at ucsb just serve to prove this point ;-None
