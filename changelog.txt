Changes:

flairs.py
	> I updated Edward's file
	> Calls get_posts instead of reading from the csv
	> Put labels on the graphs

Post_Scraper.py
	> Made the way you get posts into a function called: get_posts()
	> You pass in the number of posts you want to request and there are optional arguments aswell
      >>> The function returns an array of {posts, last_date}, It is important that you either set a variable
	  to the last date or you index the function call

post_precprocessor.py
	> Call preprocess_posts(posts) after getting the posts from get_posts() 
	> This makes sure the post is valid and removes annoying things in the text
      >>> preprocess_posts() returns an array of {result, num_deleted}. You have to either set two variables or
	  get zero index of the output to get the array you want

word_utility.py
	> I added the tokenize function which uses the __sent_to_words helper function
	> tokenize takes the preprocessed post array and converts it to the input for remove_stopwards()
