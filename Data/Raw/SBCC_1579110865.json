As altruistic as this may sound, there is a much more insidious truth lurking beneath the surface. This once beautiful campus has fallen into the disgusting clutches of the leftist horde. The very same people who bring over illegal immigrants who go on to commit serious crimes such as rape and murder. These people would have you share a table with these subhuman savages! They mock your heritage by saying that \u201cyou took our native lands\u201d, and \u201cmen have no right to state their opinion cause muh uterus.\u201d One only needs to look at \u201cprofessor\u201d Annette Cordero to realize the severity of the disease plaguing our campus. A common occurrence within her classroom is her constant berating of students for \u201ctaking her land,\u201d as if they were at fault for her ancestors being weak-willed and ignorant. Trying to defend the pride of the Chumash is an uphill and losing battle all in one, seeing as how they truly have no pride or dignity to defend. With the highest rate of alcoholism in the country it is truly a shame that these are the same \u201cpeople\u201d that claim ownership over land that we conquered and won from them.\u00a0 Her blatant bias towards liberal ideology is more than obvious when one takes a look at some of her course material. Even though we are only 2 weeks into the semester, she has already assigned 2 articles which claim that traditional gender norms are detrimental to a child's development. Ironic that she proclaims through her articles that she cares about children, when she is a staunch supporter of abortion. The norm of students agreeing with her drivel is more than worrisome, as I fear that my fellow classmates may have already fallen prey to the brainwashing and propaganda of the left. But Cordero is but a simple cyst among malignant tumors within the school and our society. One of these tumors is the obsession that the administration seems to have with coddling the illegal alien population within our campus. This filth is offered almost every single commodity at our school free of cost, while some of us have to pay full price because of these parasites taking up all our resources. So yes, these filthy animals are receiving free education at your expense my dear reader, seeing as how our taxes also go towards financial aid and improving the school. I myself once overheard a conversation between a financial aid official and an illegal where the official told him to \u201cput less earned per year so that you get even more money\u201d, per her own words. This same courtesy would not be offered to those of us who do not tick off enough diversity boxes I can promise you that.So not only are they aiding these illegals, they are also quite simply committing fraud! All just because the poor little savages need money to keep up their drug habits. Disgusting animals the lot of them. Well I say no more!\u00a0 We must make a stand against this obvious invasion! We must band together and fight back against the bastardization of our once beautiful campus and country! The traitors in congress and Sacramento have time and time again shown that they don\u2019t care about us one bit! It is time we remind all traitors, invaders and degenerates why there was a time in which they feared even showing their disgusting noses! You are not forgotten! You are not alone! Get out there and fight back! In every single way that you can! Remind the fools of their true place in society, at our feet! This is OUR home, OUR country! Long Live Washington! And Long Live America!","11":"I'm a student taking prerequisite grad school classes here after graduating with a BA from UCSB.

I\u2019ve worked so hard all four years and participated in so many extracurriculars and took so many AP classes, but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t enough to get me to where I really wanted to be. I got rejected from all the UC\u2019s that I really wanted to go to and surprisingly didn\u2019t get into one CSU, and now I\u2019ve just been in a slump and not sure where I really wanna go with my life and I have been wondering if maybe I\u2019m not good enough for what I want to do, which is go into biological sciences and hopefully become an OB\/GYN. So now I\u2019m stuck. I have an okay selection of schools, including: University of the Pacific, WSU, UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz, and  Azusa Pacific, but not where I can see myself going for four years or where I can be happy. So now I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m going to go to SBCC, and try to do the TAG program to transfer to UCSB or UCI, but the only thing worrying me is if I\u2019ll be able to get a 3.4 cumulative with biological sciences.

Right now,  I am not happy with my current situation and just really want to start over I guess (long story short don't have any real close friends, the ones I had moved away,  family is pretty dysfunctional and our strained relationships, hate my current college, the weather in general drives me crazy and over all feel like I am just treading water with no real direction or tangible goals) My ~ideal plan would be to transfer to SBCC and eventually transfer to a UC school and earn my bachelors. It seems SBCC offers housing resources which isn't super expensive (well at least comparable to apartments in MA). I think SBCC would push me outside my comfort zone especially with their housing options and force me to make friends.  I also think being so far from home will force me to stand on my own two feet too.  Am I being realistic or totally crazy? How do I go about such a big move?

During weekdays, I prefer to focus on school and maybe go out to eat or skate for a bit or just hangout with some friends, nothing to crazy. After I finish this work on the week, when the weekend comes I love to party, normally I go out Friday and Saturday night. I don't smoke weed but ocassionally willl at parties. At parties I also drink, but am not too big into just drinking for fun outside of a party. So in summary, I am a bit of a nerd on weekdays but when the weekend comes around I like to go hard at parties. Also, I have visited SB many times and would prefer to live in Isla Vista.

Van is a very inspirational speaker and this would be a great opportunity for students.\n\nSaturday Oct 29th; 7:00-8:30pm: Marjorie Luke Theater 721 East Cota St.; $10 students, $20 general public.\n\nVan Jones Biography\nOur country is in the depths of an economic recession and ecological crisis. We need nine million new jobs in the United States. They must be jobs that can support families and jobs that do no harm to the environment. America needs her best minds generating smart and innovative ideas to create more jobs. Van Jones is one of those people.\n\nVan Jones is a globally recognized, award-winning pioneer in human rights and the clean-energy economy. He is the best-selling author of the definitive book on green jobs: The Green-Collar Economy. He served as the green jobs advisor in the Obama White House in 2009.\n\nVan is currently a senior fellow at the Center For American Progress. Additionally, he is a senior policy advisor at Green For All.\n\nVan also holds a joint appointment at Princeton University, as a distinguished visiting fellow in both the Center for African American Studies and in the Program in Science, Technology and Environmental Policy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.\n\nThe Clean-Energy Economy\nVan is the founder of Green For All, the national organization working to get green jobs to disadvantaged communities. He was the main advocate for the Green Jobs Act, which George W. Bush signed into law in 2007. The Act was the first piece of federal legislation to codify the term \"green jobs.\" Under the Obama administration, it has resulted in $500 million for green job training nationally.\n\nHuman Rights\nWhile best known for his promotion of green jobs, Van has been hard at work for nearly two decades, fashioning solutions to some of urban America's toughest problems. In addition to Green For All, he is the co-founder of two social justice organizations: the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and Color of Change.\n\nAwards &amp; Honors\nVan's work has earned him many awards and honors, including:\nVan was named by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.\nVan was designated by the World Economic Forum as a \"Young Global Leader.\"\nVan is a recipient of the international Ashoka Fellowship.\nVan was one of Essence Magazine's 25 most inspiring African Americans in 2008. Last year, Ebony Magazine named him one of the Power 150.\n\nBoards\nVan is on the board of several organizations and non-profits, including:\nDemos\nNational Resources Defence Council\nRFK Memorial\nCampaign For America's Future","80":"I'm bored."},"comments":{"0":["Glad I could help!!

Dm me if you have anymore questions "],"29":[],"30":[],"31":["If you won't have a car, I'd recommend living closer to CC. There's an \"express\" bus from IV area to SBCC, but I've heard from others it can take up to an hour still.","Yeah I wont have a car. I will be walking or taking the bus my entire time there. I cant afford another car in Cali","I think that person just drives really slow, it is *absolutely not* a 30 minute drive on a good day. Without traffic, you're looking at an approximately 15 minute drive. I've done it in 12 minutes before. There are times where traffic is randomly heavy and that can make it take 30 minutes, but that's not normal.\n\nThe commute itself is fine, the problem with driving to SBCC is the parking situation. It can be pretty difficult to find a spot, particularly at the start of a semester. I went to SBCC for 3 years all while living in IV, the commute is a piece of cake. You just gotta \n\n1) leave early enough to give yourself time to find parking\n\n2) know where all of the parking lots are\n\n3) carpool with someone. There are special parking lots that you can only use if you carpool. I used to carpool with my roommate to CC at around 10am and I almost always found a spot in the carpool lots right when I got there.\n\n4) know places to park that are off campus in case the parking situation is really bad. Sometimes parking off campus and walking the rest of the way is faster than just driving around looking for a spot. \n\nAnd while I'm talking about parking, it can be very difficult to find a parking spot in IV at night unless you have a reserved parking spot.\n\n\nThat said, if I could go back in time and do it again, I would probably have just stayed in IV for my first year and then moved to the mesa or some other place that is actually normal. IV can be fun and all but I was sick of all of the fuckery that goes on there by the time I had lived there for 1.5 years, but that first year I lived there was super fun. Living in IV is just too much once you're used to it, especially when you've got an 8am class the next day and your upstairs neighbors won't turn down the fucking music. I'm not saying that will be your exact situation, but it was mine for a long time; people just make too much noise in IV. People blast music too much, people get into yelling matches in the streets at 2am too much, people break beer bottles in the streets too much, people rev their loud ass cars at stop signs at 2am too much. Living in a place with a lesser concentration of college students means you will naturally deal with the above scenarios less often. It's just not a great place to live when there are so many other options in SB\/Goleta.\n\nSome people can't get enough of it, maybe that will be you. I'm one of the people that got sick of it. One great thing about living in IV is that it can allow for you to get the complete \"college experience\" even though you're a CC student, that's the case with me. I lived at Tropicana Gardens my first year, so I basically got the same dorming experience that a UCSB student would get by staying at the UC dorms. My first year of IV was one of the best years of my life. Getting to experience IV as a newcomer was a blast, there are tons of food places to walk to even late at night, and almost all of the other freshmen just wanna drink and have fun. I'm not sure if you're an incoming freshman or what, I'm just giving my story. But after a bit you get sick of eating in IV, the people will get annoying, and you'll wanna live someplace that doesn't have young drunk people running around all the time.\n\nThe city of Santa Barbara has so much to offer, it's a wonderful place to be and I hope I can find a job there and return someday. Don't think that you will be missing out on the fun just because you don't live in IV.","It depends on what you want from the experience. Downtown is definitely cheaper and closer but that's really if you're here to focus on school only. But at that point, why not go to CC in your hometown \\(imo anyway\\)? If you really want a taste of the area \\(especially if you are going to transfer to UCSB after\\) I'd recommend living on 67 block \\(DP, Sabado, Pasado, etc.\\) in IV. The reason why is because it's far enough from UCSB campus to get you really cheap rent but a nice place, while still being relatively close to other students\/IV ","In my opinion that's a much better option. Buena Vista, Cliff House, and The Ivy are pretty nice and close to campus ","Oh screw that I think I'll just go to IV on certain days then. (probably for the better anyway)","From IV to campus on a good day is 30 mins, on a bad traffic day more like 45","How bads the commute between the two?","If you're coming to party, shoot for IV. If you want easy access to campus and downtown, there's a couple solid apartments real close that will be much better for that. "],"32":["The guarantee requires the GPA. SBCC is almost like a feeder school into UCSB so you can just apply and probably get in after a few years at SBCC. Biology also has a really gnarly class sequence and amount of required classes so be ready!

I\u2019m sure that Bio sciences is involved because they announced this in my marine bio class.
